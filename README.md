# Learning-Assembly

My journey in learning x86_64 NASM assembly:

1. "HelloWorld.asm" a simple hello world program to mark the start
2. "Infinite loop" trying out jump commands
3. "conditions" combining jump commands with compare statments to make an if
4. "Pointer" finding out how large is a 32 bit stack
